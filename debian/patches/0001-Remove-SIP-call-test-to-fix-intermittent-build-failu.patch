Subject: Remove SIP call test to fix intermittent build failure

This test might be failing intermittently depending on environment it is build
on. I have no final conclusive analysis yet, but sound reasoning as to what
might be going on:

The build failure in question can occure during the last stage of the SIP
tests, which creates two local account instances Alice and Bob listening for
SIP signalling on ports 5060 and 5061 respectively. These two instances are
trying to call each other.

When a call is established a GStreamer pipeline is being fed the host and port
properties for the UDP elements to use from the previous SDP negotiation. The
problem appears to be the following: The INVITE is sent to "127.0.0.1" and the
GStreamer pipeline is prepared accordingly. The receiving side can end up
reporting the INVITE as coming from $HOSTNAME which in turn, is then used for
its own GStreamer pipeline. The hostname appears then to be resolved to an IPv6
address which may lead to an error on the GStreamer side in the following code:

if (family == G_SOCKET_FAMILY_IPV6 && !sink->used_socket_v6)
    goto invalid_family;

leading to the GST_ELEMENT_ERROR:

Bail out! CallsSipMediaPipeline-FATAL-WARNING: Error on the message bus: Could not get/set settings from/on resource. (../gst/udp/gstmultiudpsink.c(1225): gst_multiudpsink_configure_client (): /GstPipeline:rtp-send-pipeline/GstUDPSink:rtp-udp-sink:
Invalid address family (got 10))

Since IPv6 support is not yet fleshed out and will receive some love during the
next development cycle upstream I believe it is acceptable to disable these
tests for the moment.
